Simple GitHub Actions to install and setup a [Cloudfoundry CLI](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli)
to get used with action workflows.

# Usage

See [action.yml](action.yml)

## Basic
```yaml
steps:
- uses: actions/checkout@v2
- uses: jvalkeal/setup-cf-cli@v0
  with:
    version: 6.51.0 # The CLI version to make available on the path.
```

## Login
There's no embedded functionality to manage anything else than just
setting up CLI into a path. For commands to do anything usefull you
need to store environment settings in a GitHub secrets and
then run login command. GitHub will then make sure that none of these
secrets are exposed to publicly visible logs.

```yaml
steps:
- name: Set up CF CLI
  uses: jvalkeal/setup-cf-cli@v0
  with:
    version: 6.51.0
- name: CF Login
  run: cf login -a $CF_API -u $CF_USERNAME -o $CF_ORG -s $CF_SPACE -p $CF_PASSWORD
  env:
    CF_API: ${{ secrets.CF_API }}
    CF_ORG: ${{ secrets.CF_ORG }}
    CF_SPACE: ${{ secrets.CF_SPACE }}
    CF_USERNAME: ${{ secrets.CF_USERNAME }}
    CF_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.CF_PASSWORD }}
```
